# Style guide for writing Julia code

## Some must-read before you write Julia code

- [Julia's official Style Guide](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/style-guide/#Style-Guide-1)
- [Blue: a Style Guide for Julia](https://github.com/invenia/BlueStyle/blob/master/README.md)
- [`JuMP` style guide and design principles](http://www.juliaopt.org/JuMP.jl/stable/style/)
- [JuliaPraxis](https://github.com/JuliaPraxis):
  - [Choosing and Using Names](https://github.com/JuliaPraxis/Naming/blob/master/README.md)
  - [Using Space](https://github.com/JuliaPraxis/Spacing/blob/master/README.md)

Whatever style you choose in the end, remember:

> A style guide is about consistency. Consistency with this style guide is important. Consistency within a project is more important. Consistency within one module or function is the most important.

> But most importantly: know when to be inconsistent -- sometimes the style guide just doesn't apply. When in doubt, use your best judgment. Look at other examples and decide what looks best. And don't hesitate to ask!
